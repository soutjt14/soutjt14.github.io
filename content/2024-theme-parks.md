# Theme Parks
Here's a rundown of some 2024 theme park highlights.

### Parks
We maintain season passes at several parks and use vacation time to, among other
things, ride roller coasters. This year we went to 19 theme parks (counting
parks like Disney World or Universal Orlando at the multiplicity of the number
of parks they contain.) Among those 19 were 4 new parks:
- _Six Flags Great Adventure_ We visited toward the end of the theme park season
  because a few rides were closing (see below in notable rides).
- _Six Flags Magic Mountain_ We gave ourselves one evening to see this park. It
  definitely wasn't enough time, but we got on a few of the rides we wanted to
  do.
- _Six Flags New England_ Jacqueline had been to this one before, but not me. We
  went while visiting her brother in Hartford.
- _Universal Studios Hollywood_ Our first trip to Universal on the west coast.
  We got to experience Super Mario World, which will soon arrive at Universal
  Orlando (our typical Universal park) when Epic Universe debuts in May 2025.

### Coasters
Visiting the new parks gave us occasion to ride some new roller coasters.
Jacqueline rode 19 new roller coasters this year and I rode 20. Notable among
the new coasters were two _strata coasters_:
- _Kingda Ka_ This 456 ft launch coaster is the tallest roller coaster in the
  world. When we heard it was possibly being closed after this year, we
  scheduled a surprise visit. Because of our (Jacqueline's) awareness, we
  managed to ride this one in its last weekend of operation. This was
  Jacqueline's 200th roller coaster credit (the 200th coaster she has ever ridden).
- _Top Thrill 2_ This is a ride at Cedar Point similar to Kingda Ka. It was
  recently redesigned and was only opened for about 6 days this year. Well, we
  timed our visit to Ohio correctly, I guess.

### Zapping
One of my favorite things to do at a theme park are the shooting rides. Getting
a score and then re-riding to improve the score is something of a gainer for me.
Jacqueline keeps copious notes of our various head-to-head competitions on these
rides and here are the highlights from this year:
- _Villain-Con_ This ride is a standing ride on a moving conveyer belt, shooting
  an Eliminator-X (TM) at minions and other targets. We rode it so much that we
  are currently #46 (me) and #77 (Jacqueline) in total points scored on the
  ride. Worldwide.
- _Men in Black: Alien Attack_ We tend to mess each other up when we ride this
  one together, so we ride separately and then compare scores. I took the win
  this year over 63 matchups, going 40-23.
- _Toy Story Mania_ We were only able to ride this once this year. Jacqueline
  dominated, like always, outscoring me by 13000 points.
