# Welcome

This is my test of zola, in particular the
[just-the-docs theme](https://github.com/jakeswenson/zola-just-the-docs) ported
from Jekyll.

Currently I'm using this site to serve a
[2024 Christmas card](@/2024-christmas-card.md).

I hope eventually to share an interactive fiction game, too. In the meantime,
you can amazingly still play the
[text-based game](https://people.math.sc.edu/southwij/game/) I created during
grad school at UofSC.

These are the steps I took to [get the site working](@/get-it-working.md).
