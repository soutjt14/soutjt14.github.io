# Running Highlights
As extra motivation to reach our mileage goals (and just because we like the
experience), we signed up for several races this year. The longest of these were
half-marathons, of which we did 3:
- _The Little Patuxent Half_ an early-February trail run along a river in
  Columbia. This year the race occurred just after a thaw, so parts of the
  course were quite muddy.
- _The Flying Pig_ a late-May race in Cincinnati, Ohio (famed for its swine
  industry, hence the name). The course has a few miles in Kentucky and lots of
  hills (too many hills!). Jacqueline commissioned a sign for me to see during
  the race, but it was placed far from where we were told it would be and only
  she saw it!
- _The Bird-In-Hand Half_ a mid-September race in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The
  proceeds for the race go to the local fire station, and you get to run through
  idyllic (though dusty) Amish farmland. We have already signed up to do the
  race again next year.
