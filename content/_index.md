# Welcome

This is my test of zola, in particular the
[just-the-docs theme](https://github.com/jakeswenson/zola-just-the-docs) ported
from Jekyll.

If you can see this, and there's no front matter inside `+++`s at the top, then
I believe we can claim success.

This is a link to my [test page](@/testpage.md), not `testpage.md` like it was
before.

These are the steps I took to [get the site working](@/get-it-working.md).
