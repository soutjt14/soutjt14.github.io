# Merry Christmas!

Dear friends and family,

I (Jeremy) decided we should have some sort of Christmas card this year.
Sometime in January, one of my aunts jokingly implied we would stop receiving
their annual greeting card if we never sent one to them. Well, that just
wouldn't do. And what better way to share some highlights from 2024 than on
github pages, rendered from markdown with `zola` and displayed in glorious
[just-the-docs](https://github.com/jakeswenson/zola-just-the-docs) documentation
theming? I guess I've joined my family's tradition of
[making](https://scribeofworlds.com/)
[our](https://southwickcoaching.com/)
[own](https://wegetscammedforyou.com/)
[websites](https://southwickfamilyfarm.com/).

A theme I see in our lives this year is _continuing_. We've gone to a few new
places and done a few new things, but life continues largely as it always has.

## State of the Union
Jacqueline and I celebrated 100 months of marriage this year (on 13 December!),
and characteristically spent a week at Orlando theme parks to mark the
occasion. We _continue_ to enjoy the rhythm of day-to-day life in our Maryland
apartment, which has been our home since 2021. For some time we've planned to
buy a house "in a year", but likely 2025 will also pass without any attempts to
enter the real estate market.

On the topic of marriage, Randy Stonehill said, "My world is very different from
those lazy bachelor years / but if I had the chance to go back I'd rather stay
right here". Well perhaps my laziness hasn't been completely cured, but
Jacqueline _continues_ to enrich my life in every way - her presence, her
insights, her systems for doing things - and she came up with a few new ways
this year: when I mentioned how much I like oats, it led to her showering me
with more than 6 varieties of Bobo's oat bars, which are now a regular staple in
the pantry; she endured the necessity of lobbying me for several weeks until I
gave in and got myself a running watch, to which I am now addicted; and she
introduced me to the TV show _Bones_, which we've been watching (rewatching in
her case) throughout the year.

## Common Defence
I keep busy at my job, which _continues_ to be a joy for me. I work in an office
with some very difficult problems and the brilliant people who solve them. This
year I became a team lead, which was a new responsibility for me. I usually
can't talk about what I do at work, but this letter provides an excellent
opportunity, since you need look no farther than this website to see the sort of
things I tend to work on. (The CI/CD and containerization, not the waxing
semi-eloquently.)

## Commerce among the several States
We _continued_ with our traveling tendencies this year. We took occasional 3-day
weekends to make drives to Syracuse, Charlotte, Durham, or Hartford to see
family. Sometimes I can travel for work, and this year we went to San Diego and
England (I also went to San Francisco but without Jacqueline). When we don't
have family or work as an excuse, we are typically traveling to theme parks, and
this year we made it to 19 different theme parks in 8 states.
([Yes, 19!](@/2024-theme-parks.md))

## Distinct Ballots
We set out this year to accrue - either by walking or running - 3024 miles in
2024 (a shared goal rather than each). We _continued_ to outdo ourselves. In
2023 we had aimed for 2523 miles but ended just over 3200. This year we passed
the 3024 mile mark on 21 October. As of this writing (24 December) we are just
past 3870 miles in 2024, on track for a bit over 3950 miles. See our running
highlights from the year [here](@/2024-running.md).

## Blessings
We look forward to what 2025 has in store and we wish you and yours a very happy
New Year!

Jeremy and Jacqueline
